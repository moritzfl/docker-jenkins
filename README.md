# docker-jenkins

Sets up a container with jenkins installed listening on port 8080.

## Usage

To run the container, do the following:

    docker run -d -P moritzf/jenkins

Your jenkins instance is now available by going to http://localhost:49153 .

### Persistent Configuration

By default, JENKINS_HOME is set to /jenkins.  The best way to persist or import configuration is to have a separate data volume for /jenkins.  Below are a few references on data volumes.
